* A problem in a small number of XML-authored courses that caused the video
  transcript download button to not work for students is fixed. If your course
  was one of the courses affected, you must re-import the course in Studio to

* A problem that prevented users with only course staff privileges from
  importing courses is resolved. (STUD-1595)
