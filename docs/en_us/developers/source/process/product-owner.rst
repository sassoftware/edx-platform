Product Owner
*************

The product owner is responsible for prioritizing pull requests from
contributors, and keeping them informed when prioritization slips. The community
managers will inform product owners of incoming pull requests that are relevant
to their team. For every sprint, each incoming pull request should either be
included in the sprint as a commitment to get the pull request reviewed, or the
product owner must inform the author of the pull request that the pull request
is still queued and is not being ignored. Contributors should be treated as
customers, and if their pull requests are delayed then they should be informed
of that, just as a product owner would inform any customer when that customerâ€™s
requests are delayed.
